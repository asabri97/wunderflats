# Wunderflats Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Wunderflats Coding Challenge for Frontend Developers. Please read the instructions in this README carefully before starting.

## Challenge: Simple React Application

We would like you to build a simple React app that is similar to our [Search Results Page](https://wunderflats.com/en/furnished-apartments/berlin).

Please build upon the barebones React application which was scaffolded with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find it in the `react-app` folder in this repository.

To query the data for the app, please use the `GET https://wunderflats-frontend-challenge-api.glitch.me` endpoint. You can find documentation for this endpoint in the [API.md file](./API.md) in case you need it.

ðŸš¨ The endpoint will randomly return errors (5% chance), make sure to handle them correctly !

When an error happens, display an error message with a button to retry the request.
ðŸ’¡ The listings price is returned in cents.

ðŸ’¡ You can find the content of the `/listings` GET request in `react-app/src/data/listings.json`.

You can find the design and all relevant measurements, assets and notes in the [Figma file](./design.fig). This file can viewed with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

Please write about your approach and anything that you would like to share with us regarding your work in the [README.md](./react-app/src/README.md) file at the root of the `react-app` folder.

### What we're looking for

- **Good code.** Code that works reliably and is easy to understand.
- **Correct implementation.** Make sure the [design](./design.fig) is implemented correctly and please follow the sticky note in the design file.
- **Frontend expertise.** Show us that you know how to use React effectively and don't neglect the HTML/CSS part. Think about different devices, their screen sizes, input methods, network conditions. Think about how impaired users and search engines might find the page accessible.
- **Build your components from scratch.** Please do not use any third-party components for this project.
- **Brief documentation.** Please edit `react-app/README.md` and briefly document your approach.

### What we're not looking for

- **Don't worry about old browsers.** You can use modern features like CSS Grid and native lazy loading.
- **You don't need to go crazy in terms of componentization.** No need to create so many files. Instead, show us how components and files help you with separation of concerns where it makes sense, and how to keep the codebase sane relative to the size of the project.
- **Redux skills.** The state management for this project is simple. Please don't use any third-party state management libraries like Redux or MobX.
